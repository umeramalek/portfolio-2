# portfolio-2
This is an updated portfolio that tells a little about me and showcases my projects all in one place. There are also ways to reach me on the website. I have also added my resume to the portfolio for the ease of recruiters


## Getting Started
made a rough hand sketch of how I wanted my website to look like. And found the closest template from bootstrap to work with 

### HTML
1. I used a template from bootstrap and tailored it to my liking.
2. The CSS within the template was very long for me go thru every line but I tried to get rid of everything I didn't need, with the site fully functional
3. There was an inbuilt javascript within the template 
4. Added an additional resume to it! Check it out!
